# Dart in motion

A simple demonstration how to use device orientation events to
implement the Shadow Hunter game.

It demonstrates how to use

- absolute/fixed positioning of Html elements
- and device orientation events

to realize an demo application which main interaction method
is to use device orientation of a mobile device.

The [game](http://www.nkode.io/assets/webtech/demos/motion)
degrades on a desktop browser to a simple demo application without noteworthy user interaction.

This demo application has been mainly realized for demonstration purposes in the
Webtech course (Computer Science Study Programme) at LÃ¼beck University of Applied Sciences, Germany.
