# Dart in motion

A simple demonstration how to use device orientation events to
implement the Shadow Hunter game. It demonstrates how to use

- absolute/fixed positioning of Html elements,
- only DOM-tree manipulations,
- and device orientation events

to realize an interactive Html based and single page demo application. The main interaction method
makes use of the device orientation of a mobile device.

The [game](http://www.nkode.io/assets/webtech/demos/motion)
degrades on a desktop browser to a simple demo application without noteworthy user interaction.

You can play this game on your mobile device using this QR code:

This demo application has been mainly realized for demonstration purposes for a
Webtech course (Computer Science Study Programme) at LÃ¼beck University of Applied Sciences, Germany.
